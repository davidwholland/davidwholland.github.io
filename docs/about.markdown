This site is the online home of David W. Holland. I'm a software engineer. I've worked in various roles both as an individual contributor and as an engineering manager. I believe tools and practices can be useful, but mostly I'm interested in working software.

If you're interested in working with me, please feel free to reach out at the email address below.
